This Python project is a Flappy Bird-style game built using the Pygame library. The game is inspired by Regular Show, where the player controls Mordecai as he tries to navigate through obstacles, similar to the mechanics of Flappy Bird. The project focuses on the implementation of classes to structure the game, making it clean, modular, and object-oriented. This game also incorporates powerups that spawn at random and help achieve a higher score.
